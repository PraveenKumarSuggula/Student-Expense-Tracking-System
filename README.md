## Brief Problem Statement

International students often face difficulties managing their finances, particularly in tracking and controlling their expenses. Existing tools may not meet their needs, especially when it comes to setting budgets, receiving spending alerts, or viewing trends. The **Student Expense Tracker and Visualizer** was created to fill this gap by providing a platform where students can log their expenses, categorize them, set and track budgets, receive alerts, and visualize their spending patterns. The goal is to help students make better financial decisions, reduce unnecessary expenses, and save money.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PraveenKumarSuggula/Student-Expense-Tracking-System.git
cd Expenses-Tracker-and-Visualizer
```

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Firebase Setup (for database/deployment)

To configure Firebase for your Angular application, follow these steps:

- Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Create a new Firebase project.
- Obtain the Firebase config file (firebase-config.json).
- Place the config file in the `src/environments/` directory given in environment setup below.

### EmailJs Setup (for notifications)

To integrate EmailJS for sending emails in your Angular application, follow these steps:

- Create an account at EmailJS.
- In the EmailJS dashboard, create a new email service.
- Set up a new email template.
- Obtain your Service ID, Template ID, and User ID from the EmailJS dashboard.
- Store these values in `src/environments/` directory given in environment setup below.

### Vercel Deployment with CI/CD (DevOps)
Since Vercel offers free hosting, I used Vercel for Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) to automate deployments. If you would like to do the same, follow the steps below:

#### 1. Install Vercel CLI
First, install the Vercel CLI globally on your machine. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

#### 2. Authenticate with Vercel
Log in to your Vercel account:
```bash
vercel login
```

#### 3. Link Your Angular Project to Vercel
Navigate to your Angular project folder and run:
```bash
vercel
```
Follow the prompts to set up your project.

#### 4. Configure vercel.json
Create a vercel.json file in the root directory of your project with the following content:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "angular.json",
      "use": "@vercel/angular"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
#### 5. Set Up GitHub CI/CD with Vercel
- Push your Angular project to GitHub.
- Go to Vercel Dashboard.
- Click "New Project" and select your GitHub repository.
- Choose "Angular" as the framework and configure build settings if needed.
- Click Deploy â€“ Vercel will handle the rest!

#### 6. Automatic Deployments
Whenever you push changes to the main or master branch, Vercel will automatically deploy your application.
To trigger a manual deployment, run:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

#### 7. Testing Deployment Locally
Before deploying, test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
vercel dev
```

## Environment Setup

Make sure to set the appropriate environment variables in `src/environments/environment.ts` or `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`. Here's an example of what to include:


5. Set up your Firebase configuration in `src/environments/environment.ts`:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebase: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
    databaseURL: 'YOUR_DATABASE_URL',
    projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
    storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
    messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
    appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID'
  },
  emailjsConfig: {
    serviceId: 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',  // Add your EmailJS service ID here
    templateId: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', // Add your EmailJS template ID here
    userId: 'YOUR_USER_ID'          // Add your EmailJS user ID here
  }
};

```
## Usage

### Running the Application Locally

To start the application locally, run:

```bash
ng serve -o
```

This will open the app in your browser at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

### Building the Application

To build the application for production, use:

```bash
ng build --configuration=production
```

This will create a `dist/` folder with the optimized build files.
